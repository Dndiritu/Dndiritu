## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a curious and impact-driven professional with a background in project planning, monitoring & evaluation, and a strong passion for data science. I recently completed a 6-month Data Science Bootcamp at AfricSDSA, gaining practical experience in Python, machine learning, and analytics tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.

I’m particularly driven by projects that improve public service delivery, support better planning, and solve real challenges in areas like healthcare, governance, and the environment.
